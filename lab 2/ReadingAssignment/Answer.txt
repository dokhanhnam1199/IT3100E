Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by 
category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No. The constructor method to build a DVD by category will be marked as duplicate with constructor method to build a DVD by title because both method are public DigitalVideoDisc(java.lang.String).
